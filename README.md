# DSA Project 3

Are you going through the thick of it? Canâ€™t find good movies to watch that everyone involved will enjoy? Popcorn Picks is for you! Movie nights are a great, low-budget way for friends and families to bond and spend quality time together. However, everyone has different tastes, so our program finds the optimal movie recommendations that keep everyone happy by suiting a multitude of different interests from different people.

Data will be received using the Letterboxd API from user accounts to best find and match previous user interests, as well as from optional user input, and possibly web-scraping (if needed for finding movie/actor similarities)
