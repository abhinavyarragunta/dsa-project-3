How It Works
Popcorn Picks generates a shortlist of movies that aligns with all inputted preferences, creating harmony in group movie selections. Here's how the magic happens:

Custom Algorithms

Built using C++/Python, the program processes the collected data and generates a curated list of movies that balances all interests, leaving no one disappointed.
HTTP Requests

All communication with the Letterboxd API and other external data sources is handled efficiently through HTTP requests.
